# barcode_match

## Description
Match the scATAC-seq cell barcode to GEX cell barcode for 10x multiome
datasets. 

## Parameters
```
barcode_match [options]
  -a aligned SAM/BAM file or TSV/CSV file [required]
  -g GEX barcode list file [required]
  -b ATAC barcode list file [required]
  -o out file name [required]
  -d split delimeter; Ignored if -t is provided. [default: ":"]
  -c barcode field column; Ignored if -t is provided. [default: 7 (0 based)]
  -t barcode tag in SAM file [default ""]
  -s suffix to add to output barcode [default: ""]
  -v verbose [default: false];
```

`-a` An aligned SAM/BAM file or a delimated file. If the file name ends
with a `.sam` or `.bam` it is treated as a such, else it is treated as
a delimated file. See options `-d`, `-c`, and `t` for parsing the cell
barcode depending on file type. [Required].  

`-g`: 10x gene-expression barcode inclusion list. [Required]

`-b`: line matched 10x ATAC-seq barcode inclusion list. [Required] 

`-o`: Output file prefix to name out files. [Required].

 `-d`: The use of this parameter varies depending on the input file
type. For SAM/BAM files, it is used when the cell barcode is encoded 
as a part of the query name (QNAME field). Split the QNAME by the 
specified delimiter. For delimated files, this is the delimeter used
to split the columns. Use "t" for tab. [Default: ":"]. 

`-c`: The use of this parameter varies depending on the input file type.
For SAM/BAM files, it is used when the cell barcode is encoded as a part
of the query name (QNAME field). Split the QNAME by the delimiter
specified by `-d` and take the barcode as the value in the columns
specified by `-c` (0 based). For example, reads that are generated by
Illumina sequencers have a FASTQ names that have 7 fields that are
separated by a ":", and the cell barcode is typically added as the 8th
field. For delimated files, it is the 0 based column of the cell
barcode. [Default: 7].   

`-t`: Used when the cell barcode is present in a SAM entry as a tag. For
example, SAM files generated by CellRanger encodes the error correct
cell barcode in the `CB` tag. If this parameter is set, `-d` and `-c`
flags are ignored. [Default: none]

`-s`

`-v`: Verbosity flag. Set the flag to print progress and statistics to
standard error. [Default: false].
